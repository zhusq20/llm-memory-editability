# ARS Academic Pipeline Orchestrator for Codex

Apply [the shared model/runtime policy](../model-runtime-policy.md): Astra is the
Codex target, explicit model choices prevail, and completion requires observable
artifacts. Give each delegated task bounded inputs, outputs and authority.


Use this template for `ars-full` and natural full-pipeline requests. Delegate
independent stage work when useful; retain sequential integrity gates.

## Dispatch Shape

The orchestrator owns stage boundaries and checkpoint stops. It may dispatch
workflow teams, but it must not silently run past a requested checkpoint.

Required starting roles:

1. `ars/academic-pipeline/agents/pipeline_orchestrator_agent.md`
2. `ars/academic-pipeline/agents/state_tracker_agent.md`
3. `ars/academic-pipeline/agents/integrity_verification_agent.md`

Optional gate roles:

- `claim_ref_alignment_audit_agent.md` when `ARS_CLAIM_AUDIT=1`.
- `collaboration_depth_agent.md` at advisory checkpoints only.

## Checkpoint Contract

- Every completed stage ends with a visible checkpoint. Continue through already
  authorized transitions; pause only for a required unresolved author decision or
  the user's requested stopping point. Record the decision and evidence that
  authorize each transition; silence or an automated continuation is not consent.
- Stage 2.5 and Stage 4.5 integrity gates are mandatory and cannot be diluted
  by advisory observer work.
- Stage 2.5 claim verification covers every HIGH-IMPACT claim plus the random
  sentinel and top-up floor defined by the v3.18 sampling contract. Scope-
  conformance and search-bounded novelty rows remain advisory-only.
- At Stage 1 corpus intake, run `ars/scripts/pdf_read_preflight.py` once for
  each locally read PDF and carry the sidecar by `ref_slug`. Re-check the file
  hash before use; `FAIL` and `UNAVAILABLE` must not be collapsed into `PASS`.
- Human-read marks may carry only user-declared `read_scope` and locators.
  Missing scope remains unknown and partial coverage remains draft-visible.
- Every revision round carries its Revision-Evidence Bundle and runs both the
  claim-strength drift audit and deterministic token-conservation checker as
  advisory-first checks.
- Citation-cache age rows remain advisory-only. Run live bibliographic
  re-validation only when `ARS_CACHE_REVALIDATE=1` was explicitly requested.
- The Stage 5 entry gate is the mandatory finalization boundary. Stage 5's
  completion checkpoint is FULL, and Stage 6 ends only after its decline path
  or terminal acknowledgement is recorded by the state tracker.
- `ARS_PASSPORT_RESET=1` promotes eligible checkpoints to Material Passport
  reset boundaries. The reset ledger must remain append-only.
- If the user asks to stop after intake, dashboard, RQ brief, or another named
  checkpoint, stop there and report the next gate instead of continuing.

## Cross-Model Dispatcher Contract

When cross-model verification was explicitly requested and consented, recognize
`[CROSS-MODEL-HANDOFF v1]` from a dispatched owner as a transport request, not
as a deliverable. Validate it with `ars/scripts/cross_model_handoff.py`, send
only the payload to the configured provider, apply the closed agreement or
divergence routing, and return any judgment work to the original owner.
Malformed handoffs or results become `unavailable`; never repair or invent them.

For Stage 3 `full` review, the consented cross-model reviewer track swaps the
existing Reviewer 2 seat and records panel provenance. At Stage 3' re-review,
run the independent Priority-1 judge pass when configured and carry its Judge
Record forward; divergence triggers synthesis review and never acts as a vote.

## Output Contract

Emit current stage, requested checkpoint, active gate, Material Passport status,
and degraded runtime behavior, if any.
