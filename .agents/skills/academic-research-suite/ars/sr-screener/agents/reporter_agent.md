# Reporter Agent — Deliverables and Handoff (Phase 6)

Produces the deliverables with `scripts/build_outputs.py`, then helps the user finish the
parts only they can write.

## Steps

1. Check completeness first: `merge_decisions.py` must print "complete". Full-text reporting
   also requires the title/abstract screening, adjudication and QC recheck to be complete.
   Every prepared record/report needs a current final decision. The retrieved/not-retrieved
   partition and TA decision snapshot must be current; refresh an out-of-date FT set before reporting.
   With pending records, `build_outputs.py` still writes a provisional log but no methods text. Do not report
   provisional numbers as results.
2. Run `python scripts/build_outputs.py --work W --out OUT --config screening_config.json`
   (`--stage ft` for full text; `--tag-keywords` if the user's reference manager groups by
   keyword, as Zotero does).
3. Walk the user through the files (see the Outputs table in `WORKFLOW.md`), in their language.
4. Complete the methods text with the user. Every `[TO COMPLETE]` slot is something only the
   team knows: dates, who verified which decisions, how disagreements with the AI were settled,
   and the final human-confirmed numbers. ⚠️ **IRON RULE:** never fill these slots with
   invented facts. If the team has not verified the decisions yet, the text must not say it has.
5. Check `model_labels` in the config: the methods text names the models from there, so they
   must be the exact models that ran.
6. Offer the handoff (next section).

## Importing the RIS groups

- **EndNote**: File > Import > File, import option "Reference Manager (RIS)", text translation
  Unicode (UTF-8). The decision is in the Label field (`TA-Include`, `TA-Unclear`,
  `TA-Exclude-E3`) and the reasons are in Notes. Create smart groups on Label to see each set.
- **Zotero / Mendeley**: import the RIS files; with `--tag-keywords` the decision also arrives
  as a tag. Import each file into its own collection to keep the sets apart.
- The Excel log is the complete record: both reviewers' labels and reasons, the adjudicator,
  QC and overrides, and who made each final decision.

## Handoff

- **academic-paper** (`full` or `lit-review` mode): give it `*_methods_selection.md`,
  `*_prisma_counts.md` and, after full text, the excluded-with-reasons sheet. For the included
  studies, give `FT_literature_corpus.yaml` (or `TA_...` before full text): its entries follow
  the ARS `literature_corpus_entry.schema.json`, so the literature strategist treats them as the
  user's curated corpus.
- **deep-research** (systematic-review mode): the same corpus file seeds its bibliography;
  risk-of-bias and synthesis continue there.
- **Material Passport**: paste the YAML list under `literature_corpus:`.

The corpus file keeps the screening decision in `tags` and `user_notes`. It has no abstracts,
because abstracts can be publisher-copyrighted and passports are often shared.
