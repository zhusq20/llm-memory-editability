description: ARS deep-research `three-way-scan` mode — WHY / HOW / WHAT paper comparison
model: sonnet
---

First invoke the Skill tool with `skill: "academic-research-skills:deep-research"`. Pass the mode and the user's request described below as its arguments. Use the loaded skill and its supporting files before producing the result.

Trigger the `deep-research` skill in `three-way-scan` mode. Produces a compact paper shortlist compared by WHY / HOW / WHAT plus a cross-paper synthesis (common WHY, divergent HOW, strongest WHAT, unresolved gap). Lighter than `lit-review`; escalate to `lit-review` / `systematic-review` for full coverage. Fidelity spectrum, low oversight.

Mode reference: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/MODE_REGISTRY.md` § deep-research.
Skill entry: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/deep-research/WORKFLOW.md`.

Resolve plugin resources from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, not from the paper project's working directory. If the skill or a required file cannot be loaded, report the loading failure and stop; do not substitute this command summary for the mode instructions.
