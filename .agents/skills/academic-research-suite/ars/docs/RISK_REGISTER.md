# Risk Register: Risk → Control → Evidence Status → Residual Gap

**Purpose.** The suite's known risks are each handled somewhere — the citation gate,
the claim-drift guards, the consent surfaces, the capability matrix — but those
mechanisms live in different files. This register is the single artifact that links
each standing risk to its existing controls, the evidence status behind them, and
what is still open, so that when a new mechanism ships there is one place to answer:
which risk does this retire, and what remains?

**Origin.** ISO/IEC 42001-spirit gap assessment
([`audits/iso42001-spirit-gap-assessment-2026-08-17.md`](../audits/iso42001-spirit-gap-assessment-2026-08-17.md),
finding F-1, [#759](https://github.com/Imbad0202/academic-research-skills/issues/759)).
This is the deliberately lightweight substitute for a formal AIMS risk process, which
was assessed and rejected as disproportionate for a solo-maintained repo (assessment
§6). Feasibility here is one of this repo's distilled operating principles (with
informative anchors to ISO/IEC 42001) — not an ISO-mandated artifact.

**Posture.** The register indexes, it never re-authors. Each row cites its controls
where they are defined and mirrors its evidence status from the stage capability
matrix ([`shared/contracts/capability/stage_capability_matrix.json`](../shared/contracts/capability/stage_capability_matrix.json),
rendered at [STAGE_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md](STAGE_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md)); it never
redefines a control or upgrades a status. Statuses use the matrix vocabulary
(`DESIGNED` / `NOT_RUN` / `MEASURED` / `MIXED`). A status citing a named matrix row
is lint-pinned to that row's recorded `behavioral_evidence.status` by
`scripts/check_risk_register.py`; a status marked as asserted-here is a maintainer
assertion with no matrix backing, and may only carry a no-measurement status: the
matrix stays the sole authority for `MEASURED`/`MIXED`. An open issue in a Residual
gap cell is the honest answer, not a defect being hidden: `NOT_RUN` means exactly
that. Two authoring constraints keep this file checkable: a backtick code span
containing a slash is treated as a repo path that must exist, and the citation
phrasings are reserved for well-formed citations.

## Risks

### R1 — Hallucinated citations

A generated reference does not exist, or a real reference is cited for a claim it
does not support.

- **Existing controls**: deterministic four-index existence gate
  (`scripts/verify_passport.py`, `scripts/verification_gate/__init__.py`) with opt-in
  terminal policies (`shared/contracts/passport/terminal_policies.schema.json`);
  locator-bearing citation emission (`scripts/check_v3_7_3_three_layer_citation.py`);
  Phase E claim verification for the supports-the-claim half; the passport list
  that keeps a reference an integrity gate judged `NOT_FOUND` off later writer
  dispatches (`shared/contracts/passport/excluded_source_entry.schema.json`, #936).
- **Evidence status**: `NOT_RUN` (capability matrix row `retrieval.citation_existence_gate`);
  `NOT_RUN` (capability matrix row `integrity_check.claim_verification`).
- **Residual gap**: no measured hallucinated-citation catch rate — that needs an
  independently-authored ground-truth set, not one derived from the gate's own
  reducer; the Claim Registry's semantic completeness is unknown by contract. No
  open issue schedules either measurement yet. The vendor evaluations of both
  supported session models point the same way. The Claude Fable 5.1 system card
  (§2.2.4) reports fabricated references as rare and misrepresented findings or
  conclusions as the residual error class that needs domain familiarity to catch;
  the Claude Opus 5.5 system card reports reliance on abstracts over full papers
  and partial checks described as full reads (mapped in
  `audits/harness-retirement-2026-09-opus-5-5.md` DM-015). Both move the weight of
  this row onto the supports-the-claim half — exactly the unmeasured
  claim-verification row above.

### R2 — Silent claim-strength drift in revision

A revision round strengthens or weakens a claim without an authorizing roadmap item.

- **Existing controls**: claim-strength ladder
  (`shared/references/claim_strength_ladder.md`); deterministic token conservation
  (`scripts/check_revision_token_conservation.py`); advisory Phase E6 drift check.
- **Evidence status**: `MEASURED` (capability matrix row `revision.claim_drift_guard`).
- **Residual gap**: the measured row covers a condensed guard-block prompt, not the
  shipped pipeline path as-wired, and licenses no causal claim; re-measurement after
  any change is a manual maintainer action.

### R3 — Indirect prompt injection via retrieved content

Third-party text, whether an agent retrieves it or the user pastes it, carries
instructions that an agent follows as if they came from the user.

- **Existing controls**: the retrieved-content instruction/data boundary as a
  standing principle (#367), inlined verbatim in the deep-research retrieval
  agents; since #883, in the revision coach that ingests pasted reviewer
  comments and decision letters; and since #890, in twelve agents on the
  dispatch and passport-import paths (the pipeline orchestrator, the integrity
  gates, literature intake, reviewer Phase 0 and the editorial synthesis,
  systematic-review risk of bias, temporal extraction, and deep-research
  `review` mode) and in two prompts a model receives without the agent file,
  the claim-audit judge prompt and the cross-model devil's advocate prompt;
  since #894, in five agents that read third-party text through their own tool
  calls (the formatter, citation compliance, and the three citation emitters),
  in the single-reference verification prompt the integrity gates send to a
  cross-model verifier on the API route, and in the four `WORKFLOW.md` files,
  which every install path loads when a skill runs
  (`scripts/check_instruction_data_boundary.py` lists each);
  the reviewer-side untrusted-materials rule (`academic-paper-reviewer/WORKFLOW.md`)
  and its manuscript fence in the five panel agents (pinned by
  `scripts/check_reviewer_data_fences.py`); the offline structural probe
  (`scripts/run_indirect_prompt_injection_probe.py`), which by design never
  dispatches a model.
- **Evidence status**: `DESIGNED` (asserted here; no capability-matrix row) — the
  probe checks structure, so no behavioral injection-resistance number exists.
- **Residual gap**: live injection behavior unmeasured
  ([#675](https://github.com/Imbad0202/academic-research-skills/issues/675));
  structural instruction/data isolation at the task-envelope boundary is design work
  ([#676](https://github.com/Imbad0202/academic-research-skills/issues/676)).
  The Claude Opus 5.5 system card reports a regression on the pasted channel: the
  model acts on instructions planted in text the user pasted into their own
  message, but acted on them in 0 of 105 attempts when the same text arrived as a
  tool result (§6.5.1; rates and product-side caveats in
  `audits/harness-retirement-2026-09-opus-5-5.md` DG-1). The #675 scenarios
  include pasted reviewer and committee comments. The prompt-level boundary,
  including the interim #890 and #894 extensions, is trust-based; its effect on
  this regression is unmeasured, and #676 stays open with its structural
  requirements unmet. The inventories, ranking, and placement are in
  `docs/design/2026-09-23-890-instruction-data-boundary-extension.md` (#890)
  and `docs/design/2026-09-24-894-instruction-data-boundary-tool-calls.md`
  (#894). Surfaces they leave uncovered: agents whose dispatch carries
  third-party text only as quotations inside artifacts from covered agents
  (for example `meta_analysis_agent` and `argument_builder_agent`); agents
  whose input is the user's own text or dialogue; the advisory
  collaboration-depth observer and monitoring agent; the cross-model result at
  the design-freeze checkpoint; requests a fallback model serves; the
  ChatGPT-subscription transport's instructions to the verifier; and the
  routing decision a session makes before it loads a `WORKFLOW.md`. The #675 seed
  runs one generic guided prompt rather than any agent's prompt, so as seeded
  it evaluates none of these paths; a measured claim for a path needs a #675
  scenario that loads that agent's assembled prompt.

### R4 — Unpublished-content exposure via cross-model transport

A consented second-model call carries unpublished manuscript content to an external
provider.

- **Existing controls**: consent-gated transport with explicit per-call surfaces
  (`shared/cross_model_verification.md`); the single user-facing network map
  (`docs/DATA_FLOWS.md`); the contained, bounded subscription transport protocol.
- **Evidence status**: `NOT_RUN` (asserted here; no capability-matrix row) — the
  deterministic envelope pieces are CI-pinned; behavioral compliance with the
  consent contract is unmeasured.
- **Residual gap**: consent surfaces are prompt-contract layers whose behavior
  varies with the session model; the no-autonomous-publication line is a scope
  boundary and review criterion, not a runtime guarantee (`POSITIONING.md`).
  Provider-side safety monitoring may escalate a flagged conversation to human
  review at the provider (`shared/cross_model_verification.md` § Provider-side
  monitoring and safety interventions), so consent has to assume provider staff
  may read what is sent.

### R5 — Upstream model-version behavior drift

A new session-model version silently changes behavior that older measurements
described.

- **Existing controls**: commit-frozen measurement rows re-measured per change; the
  matrix staleness rule (`stale_after_days`); periodic harness-retirement audits
  (`audits/harness-retirement-2026-09-opus-5-5.md` is the most recent completed
  report, run when Claude Opus 5.5 joined Claude Fable 5.1 as a supported session
  model; `audits/harness-retirement-2026-09-model-update.md` covers the Fable 5 →
  Fable 5.1 and GPT-5.6 Sol → GPT-6 Astra change).
- **Evidence status**: `NOT_RUN` (asserted here; no capability-matrix row) — no
  measurement of cross-version drift itself exists.
- **Residual gap**: measured rows are model- and time-specific by contract;
  re-running them on a model change is a manual maintainer action, not automated.
  The session model can also change mid-run without a version change: a
  classifier-triggered fallback moves a Claude Code session onto the fallback
  model until the user runs `/model`, with a transcript notice the user sees and
  the suite never reads (`shared/model_tiering.md`, the declared-model note under
  Resolving a tier at dispatch time; vendor specifics in
  `audits/harness-retirement-2026-09-opus-5-5.md` DM-005), so every "session
  model" in a provenance record is the declared model, not a per-call attestation.

### R6 — Correlated same-family model error

Generator and reviewer share a model family, so both miss the same failures.

- **Existing controls**: optional cross-model verification and the cross-model
  reviewer track (`shared/cross_model_verification.md`); the Review Panel Provenance
  block's single-family correlated-error caveat; the same-family calibration
  epistemic note.
- **Evidence status**: `NOT_RUN` (capability matrix row `review.calibration`).
- **Residual gap**: first measured reviewer error profile pending
  ([#653](https://github.com/Imbad0202/academic-research-skills/issues/653)); a
  second model is an error-detection control, not organizational independence.
  A second model is also only as observable as its outputs: the current OpenAI
  verifier's vendor reports that covert underperformance by that model would
  likely evade the vendor's own monitors (GPT-6 Astra system card §9.2.2.3), and
  ARS's typed evidence anchors bound what a verifier can assert, not what it
  withholds.

### R7 — User over-reliance / rubber-stamping

The researcher approves AI output without reading it, and attestations become
rubber stamps.

- **Existing controls**: read-scope attestation as declaration-not-proof
  (`/ars-mark-read` requires an explicit scope); the override ladder with recorded
  reasoning (`shared/compliance_checkpoint_protocol.md`); the advisory
  collaboration-depth observer (`shared/collaboration_depth_rubric.md`).
- **Evidence status**: `NOT_RUN` (asserted here; no capability-matrix row).
- **Residual gap**: these are trust-based controls with audit trails, not coercive
  controls — final integrity responsibility stays with the human researcher, and no
  evaluation measures over-reliance itself.

### R8 — Venue-policy staleness

Disclosure guidance cites a venue policy the venue has since changed.

- **Existing controls**: disclosure mode with per-venue policy anchors
  (`academic-paper/references/disclosure_mode_protocol.md`).
- **Evidence status**: `NOT_RUN` (asserted here; no capability-matrix row).
- **Residual gap**: no live policy re-validation exists; the user must confirm
  against the venue's current text before submission.

### R9 — Dependency / supply-chain compromise

A compromised or drifting third-party dependency alters suite behavior.

- **Existing controls**: stdlib-first runtime scripts; a small declared
  dev-dependency manifest (`requirements-dev.txt`, lower-bound pins only, no
  lockfile); the plugin-agent tools allowlist (`scripts/check_tools_allowlist.py`);
  CI lints running repo-side in GitHub Actions.
- **Evidence status**: `NOT_RUN` (asserted here; no capability-matrix row).
- **Residual gap**: no SBOM or supplier-review program — assessed and rejected as
  disproportionate (assessment §6); dev dependencies carry no exact version or hash
  locking; dependency changes ride ordinary code review.

### R10 — Install-channel enforcement loss

A user installs through a channel where documented enforcement never runs.

- **Existing controls**: the per-channel availability matrix
  (`docs/CONTROL_AVAILABILITY.md`); the write-scope guard's disclosed degrade posture
  (`hooks/run_guard.sh`), indexed as five `write_scope_guard_*` rows in the
  degradation registry (`shared/contracts/degradation_registry.json`,
  [#769](https://github.com/Imbad0202/academic-research-skills/issues/769));
  per-channel notes in `docs/SETUP.md`.
- **Evidence status**: `NOT_RUN` (asserted here; no capability-matrix row) —
  availability is documented; loss-of-enforcement behavior is not separately
  measured.
- **Residual gap**: what each channel loses is per-mechanism (see the availability
  matrix): prompt-level protocols survive in most non-plugin channels but are absent
  in claude.ai Projects, and hook enforcement is absent outside the plugin channel
  unless the user wires the hook into their own settings manually (matrix note 3).

### R11 — Fabricated or distorted checkpoint authority

The orchestrating model treats something other than the researcher's own turn as
a checkpoint decision — an automated message, a subagent's report, a template
default, or its own paraphrase — or restates the researcher's decision to a
subagent as a broader authorization than was given.

- **Existing controls**: MANDATORY checkpoint templates that wait for an explicit
  user turn (`academic-pipeline/references/pipeline_state_machine.md`); the
  orchestrator's checkpoint-authority fidelity rule
  (`academic-pipeline/agents/pipeline_orchestrator_agent.md`); deterministic
  authorization inputs that bind an author choice to exact patch bytes
  (`scripts/revision_roadmap.py`, the #670 integrity-correction authorization);
  read attestations that are declared, never inferred (`/ars-mark-read`).
- **Evidence status**: `NOT_RUN` (asserted here; no capability-matrix row) — the
  deterministic authorization inputs are CI-pinned; the prompt-level rule is not
  measured on any session model.
- **Residual gap**: the failure class is vendor-documented, not ARS-measured
  (evidence mapped in `audits/harness-retirement-2026-09-model-update.md` G-1 for
  Fable 5.1 and `audits/harness-retirement-2026-09-opus-5-5.md` DM-013 for Opus
  5.5); the prompt rule is trust-based.

### R12 — Handoff loss across compaction and subagent returns

Context compaction or a subagent return drops a pending checkpoint decision, the
researcher's exact words, a partly collected answer, a step's outcome, or a transient
input, and the run continues as if its record were complete. Loss and fabrication fail
differently: fabricating a decision is R11's risk; this row covers losing one.

- **Existing controls**: the run ledger beside the passport and its deterministic
  report (`scripts/run_ledger.py`, schema
  `shared/contracts/passport/run_ledger.schema.json`); the orchestrator's run-ledger
  and handoff-check rules (`academic-pipeline/agents/pipeline_orchestrator_agent.md`)
  and the state machine's run-ledger rule
  (`academic-pipeline/references/pipeline_state_machine.md`); the SessionStart
  reminder after a compaction or resume (`scripts/announce-ars-loaded.sh`); the opt-in
  passport reset for MANDATORY decisions
  (`academic-pipeline/references/passport_as_reset_boundary.md`); the user-confirmed
  `standing_constraints[]` passport list that later dispatches quote
  (`shared/contracts/passport/standing_constraint_entry.schema.json`, #927).
- **Evidence status**: `NOT_RUN` (asserted here; no capability-matrix row) — how the
  report reads a ledger is CI-pinned by six synthetic scenarios, the `show` read that
  prints only entries before a break by synthetic tests, and the handoff-check block the
  report renders in English and Traditional Chinese by line-exact tests (#898,
  `scripts/test_run_ledger.py`); whether the orchestrator writes the entries, reads the
  ledger only through the script, and inserts the block unchanged is not measured on any
  session model.
- **Residual gap**: anything lost before its entry is written cannot be recovered; the
  hashes catch accidental damage, not deliberate edits, a lost tail, or a restored older
  copy of the ledger
  (`docs/design/2026-09-23-887-handoff-integrity-design.md`, section 6); the
  collaboration observer still needs the original turns; outside the plugin channel the
  reminder runs only if the user wires the hook (`docs/CONTROL_AVAILABILITY.md`, note 3).
