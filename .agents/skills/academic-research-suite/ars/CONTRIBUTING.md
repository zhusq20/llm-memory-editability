# Contributing to Academic Research Skills

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This document explains what kinds of contributions we accept and how to submit them.

## How to submit a contribution

ARS uses the standard **fork-and-PR** workflow. Fork the repo on GitHub, clone your fork, create a branch, make your changes, push to your fork, then open a PR against `Imbad0202/academic-research-skills`.

**Important**: You cannot push directly to this repo — you must fork it first and submit a PR from your fork.

## What we accept

### Community-maintained (fast merge)

These contributions can be merged quickly with minimal review:

- **Typo and formatting fixes** — spelling, broken links, markdown rendering issues
- **New examples** — pipeline output showcases, worked examples for specific disciplines
- **Translation improvements** — better phrasing in READMEs. Translations that touch operative instructions (agent definitions, IRON RULE text, integrity protocols, trigger keywords) are not fast-merge; they follow the review tier of the file they touch, even when presented as translation.

### Requires maintainer review

These need careful review because they affect system behavior:

- **Journal and field reference lists** — additions to `top_journals_by_field.md`, new discipline glossaries
- **Evaluation sets** — gold-standard papers for calibration mode, benchmark data
- **New reference files** — methodology guides, citation format references, domain-specific protocols
- **Bug and drift fixes** — version inconsistencies, broken cross-references, incorrect metadata
- **Mode changes** — new modes, trigger keyword changes, oversight level adjustments

### Requires maintainer approval + discussion

Open an issue first before submitting a PR for these:

- **Agent definition changes** — modifications to any file in `*/agents/*.md`
- **IRON RULE modifications** — any change to rules marked with the IRON RULE marker
- **Ethics and integrity rules** — changes to the failure mode checklist, integrity protocols, or ethics review
- **Handoff schema changes** — modifications to `shared/handoff_schemas.md`
- **New skills or modes** — additions to the pipeline

### Platform ports (community-maintained only)

This repository is the reference distribution of ARS, built for Claude Code. Ports to other agent platforms (Opencode, Cursor, Continue, Aider, etc.) are accepted as community-maintained contributions. Two structural shapes are acceptable — both keep core ARS content as the source of truth:

- **In-tree wrapper.** Add a top-level `<platform>/` directory in this repo (e.g. `opencode/`) containing the manifest, plugin entry, and dispatch shims. Core ARS files (`skills/*/WORKFLOW.md`, `agents/*.md`, `shared/`, `scripts/`) remain unmodified.
- **Sibling distribution.** A separate repository that vendors ARS workflow content with: (1) upstream commit hash pinned (e.g. in a `manifest.json`); (2) a written update / sync policy; (3) vendored content unmodified — only the outer routing / adapter layer is platform-specific.

Either shape is accepted under the same maintainer-facing conditions:

- **Named maintainer.** The PR description (in-tree) or repo README (sibling) must identify who will keep the port in sync with ARS minor releases (~6-week cadence) and triage platform-specific bug reports. Platform-specific issues will be redirected to that maintainer.
- **End-to-end evidence.** Include at least one full `academic-pipeline` run on the target platform, committed under `examples/<platform>/` (in-tree) or under an `examples/` path in the sibling repo, so regressions are detectable.
- **Claims-evidence alignment.** Every load-bearing, verifiable claim a port makes about its own behavior (in its README, docs, or evidence bundle — e.g. "does not add X to ordinary prompts", "prevents automatic invocation") must ship with contributor-run evidence covering the claim's stated scope; a claim whose evidence covers less is narrowed to what the evidence covers. Maintainer review checks that alignment and conformance with ARS principles (human-in-the-loop, degraded-mode disclosure) — it does not re-derive the target platform's runtime behavior. Platform expertise and post-merge maintenance stay with the port maintainer.
- **Model-portability note.** ARS prompts are calibrated against Claude (Opus for architecture/review, Sonnet for execution; never Haiku). The PR must document which providers/models were tested and where downstream-agent behavior diverged from the Claude baseline.
- **Open a design issue first** before submitting the PR (for in-tree) or before requesting sibling-distribution recognition in this repo's README.

### Locale packs (community-maintained)

ARS ships one default locale: English plus Traditional Chinese (zh-TW), the pairing the bilingual abstract, the Chinese citation guide, the worked examples, and the PDF fonts assume. Support for another output locale is delivered as a **locale pack**, and every non-default pack is community-maintained, whether it lives under `locales/<locale>/` in this repository or in a sibling distribution. The maintainer owns the extension interface and the default behaviour; the maintainer does not translate, review, or support a pack's language content.

Until the locale mechanism lands (Phase 1 tracked in #862, design in #850), activation-layer contributions are still accepted on their own: a translated README under the existing README drift lints, and conservative, intent-specific trigger phrases under the #509 rules (no broad standalone words, routing smoke evidence, boundary fixtures under `tests/fixtures/issue_133_routing/`, and all four `description` fields kept under the Agent Skills 1,024-character limit).

A pack is accepted and stays listed as supported under these conditions:

- **Two named owners.** A primary owner and a distinct backup owner, both stated in the pack's manifest, who accept language review, locale-specific issues, and synchronisation with every ARS minor release. Locale-specific issues are redirected to them.
  - *Provisional applications.* A single-owner application may be recorded as provisional in a dedicated issue once the primary owner accepts these responsibilities there. A provisional application is not a supported pack. The first minor release after both the locale mechanism and that acceptance opens a 14-day window in which a distinct backup owner must accept the same responsibilities; the maintainer records the qualifying release and deadline in the issue. If the window closes without a backup, the application expires, and reapplication requires two accepted owners and current evidence. A supported pack that loses either owner leaves the supported list until two owners are again accepted.
- **Recorded currency.** The pack records the last upstream commit and release it was verified against, the capabilities it covers, and reproducible validation evidence. Within 14 days of each minor release the owners either update the pack or record a compatibility attestation for the new release.
- **Visible staleness.** CI fails visibly for a listed pack whose compatibility record is stale, whose tracked upstream dependencies changed, or whose mappings, assets, or required fixtures are missing or invalid. A missed deadline marks the pack stale and removes it from the supported list; this never delays a core release. Two consecutive missed minor releases, or the loss of both owners, allow the pack to be deprecated and unbundled. Reinstatement requires accepted ownership and current evidence.
- **Configuration and presentation only.** A pack supplies documented configuration and presentation assets: trigger phrases, the output-language pair, citation-guide mapping, example sets, fonts. It never replaces or overlays core `WORKFLOW.md` files, agent definitions, IRON RULE text, integrity protocols, handoff schemas, modes, or oversight rules. A change that alters workflow semantics goes through normal maintainer review even when it arrives as translation.
- **Trigger discipline.** Trigger phrases follow the #509 rules above; a pack cannot widen a skill's activation with standalone words.

Third-party directory listings in `THIRD_PARTY.md` remain a separate, non-endorsement channel and do not confer supported-pack status.

## PR guidelines

- **One concern per PR** — don't mix unrelated changes
- **Describe what and why** — explain the motivation, not just the change
- **Reference issues** — if your PR addresses an open issue, link it
- **Test your changes** — if you're modifying agent definitions, try running the skill to confirm it works as expected
- **Keep READMEs in sync** — if your change affects user-facing documentation, update `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, `README.ja-JP.md`, `README.ko-KR.md`, and `README.es-ES.md` when applicable

## Governance

### Maintainer

The repo is maintained by [Cheng-I Wu](https://github.com/Imbad0202) (HEEACT). The maintainer has final say on all merges.

### Decision principles

1. **Accuracy over completeness** — we'd rather have fewer, verified journal entries than a long unvetted list
2. **Human-in-the-loop always** — contributions that reduce human oversight or enable fully autonomous paper generation will be declined
3. **No detection evasion** — features designed to make AI-generated text harder to detect (as opposed to higher quality) are out of scope. See [Issue #3](https://github.com/Imbad0202/academic-research-skills/issues/3) for context.
4. **Discipline diversity welcome** — ARS defaults to higher education research but aims to be domain-agnostic. Discipline-specific modules are encouraged.

## Release checklist

Most release mechanics are CI-enforced (`check_version_consistency.py` keeps CLAUDE.md / WORKFLOW.md / CHANGELOG / plugin manifests / README badge in lockstep; the release-cooldown workflow paces tags; the `changelog-covers-merges` workflow gates release-prep PRs). Not every workflow enforces at the same strength — the per-workflow classification (blocking / advisory / administrative / post-push detection, with bypass tokens) lives in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §7.1](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#71-ci-workflow-enforcement-classes-755). One step still has a manual form for tag flows that skip a release branch:

The six READMEs (`README.md` and the five translations) summarize only the three most recent releases; `README_CHANGELOG_KEEP` in `scripts/check_spec_consistency.py` pins that list and fails on any extra `### v` heading. At release time, prepend the new release's paragraph to each README, drop the oldest, and put the English paragraph as the blockquote under the new `CHANGELOG.md` entry (the full history lives there; the translated summaries up to v3.21.2 are frozen under `docs/changelog-archive/`).

### Before tagging: CHANGELOG covers every merge

CI runs this automatically on every release-prep PR (head branch `release/**`): the `Changelog Covers Merges` workflow audits every release-worthy commit merged to `main` since the previous release tag and fails unless its issue/PR number (`#N`) is referenced in `CHANGELOG.md` **above the previous release's section** — under `## [Unreleased]`, or under the version section the prep PR just promoted (spec §0.2).

For a tag cut without a `release/` branch, run the same gate by hand from the release-prep state (**before** the `vX.Y.Z` tag exists): `python3 scripts/check_changelog_covers_merges.py`. Resolve each finding (add a CHANGELOG entry citing its `#N`) or confirm it is legitimately exempt (a `chore`/`test`/`ci`/`build` commit, or an internal `docs(design)`/`docs(superpowers)` commit, or the once-per-release `docs(release)` alignment commit; `docs(i18n)` is deliberately NOT exempt — translation changes are user-facing). This is the machine-checked half of the `[doc-aligned: yyyy-mm-dd]` tag-message discipline. Run it on the release-prep state, not on a feature branch — in-progress branch commits have no PR suffix yet and will report as unverifiable (CI avoids this by auditing `--merges-ref origin/main`).

One convention is editorial and lives here:

### `Real-use findings` subsection (#395)

When drafting a release's CHANGELOG entry, include a **`Real-use findings`** subsection if any of the release's issues were discovered through actual use of the suite on a real paper — one line per issue, naming the run that surfaced it. Paper-derived / external-motivation work (the Zhao / Kong / Kim tracks) does NOT belong here; the subsection exists precisely to make the other provenance class visible. Background: the v3.6.7 production chapter run surfaced 17 drift patterns, but that lived-experience provenance was buried in spec prose with no fixed, greppable home — and release motivation since v3.8 has been almost entirely external papers, which is itself a signal worth seeing per release. If a release has no real-use findings, omit the subsection; never pad it.

## Academic integrity policy

This repo is designed to be **assistive, not deceptive**. See [POSITIONING.md](POSITIONING.md) for the full design philosophy. Contributors must not add features designed to evade AI detection tools. If unsure, open an issue to discuss before submitting a PR.

## When adding a new skill

Read [`shared/ground_truth_isolation_pattern.md`](shared/ground_truth_isolation_pattern.md) before writing the WORKFLOW.md. It explains the three-layer model behind the `data_access_level` and `task_type` frontmatter fields and lists the do/don't rules for handling evaluation rubrics, gold labels, and answer keys.
