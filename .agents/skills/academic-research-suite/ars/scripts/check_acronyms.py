"""Deterministic acronym check for a manuscript (#849).

Reads one Markdown or plain-text file and never changes it. No model call.
It checks three rules in each scope (the body, the English abstract, and the
Chinese abstract), and each scope defines its acronyms on its own:

  undefined           an acronym is used in a scope that never defines it;
  defined_after_use   its first use in a scope comes before the scope's first
                      definition;
  defined_again       a scope defines the same acronym more than once.

A definition is a parenthetical whose last item is the acronym, placed after
text in the same paragraph (a line break inside a paragraph reads as a space),
when the words before it spell the acronym: ``randomized controlled trial
(RCT)``, ``大型語言模型（LLM）``, or ``隨機對照試驗（randomized controlled
trial, RCT）``. Chinese words spell any acronym, and quotation and emphasis
marks around the words are ignored (``「大型語言模型」（LLM）``,
``（*大型語言模型*，LLM）``); Latin words spell it when
the first starts with the acronym's first letter and their initials contain
its letters in order. The expansion is the shortest such run of words. For
Chinese words before the parenthetical, which have no spaces between them, it
is the whole run of Chinese characters there, read across a space or line
break between two of them; any other character, such as punctuation, a digit,
or a Latin letter, ends the run, so it can hold words before the term
(``本研究採用結構方程模型（SEM）``) or lose a part of it (``2型糖尿病（T2D）``
gives ``型糖尿病``). Two kinds of acronym get no finding in their scope and
are listed as coverage limits: one whose parenthetical the words do not spell
(``several methods (RCT)``), which this check cannot confirm as a definition,
and one followed by its expansion in parentheses (``RCT (randomized controlled
trial)``, ``RCT（隨機對照試驗）``), a definition form this check does not
read. Words after the acronym count as its expansion when they spell it, so a
list whose initials spell it counts too (``ML (MARS, LASSO, and random
forests)``). A parenthetical is a use, not a definition, when it opens with
``e.g.``, ``e. g.``, ``eg``, ``see``, ``cf.``, ``for example``,
``for instance``, ``such as``, ``including``, ``例如``, ``比如``, ``諸如``, or
``包括``, before or after the acronym (``(e.g., RCT)``,
``RCT (including recruitment)``), or when it is made only of acronyms,
counting excluded ones, symbols, numbers, and joining words or marks, before
or after the acronym (``(SEM, RCT)``, ``ML (MARS, LASSO)``, ``(SDs, RMSE)``,
``(R², AIC, BIC)``, ``(n = 120, RCT)``, ``(PCA/ICA, NMF)``,
``(COVID-19, ARDS)``, ``(PCA and ICA, NMF)``, ``（PCA與ICA，NMF）``). So are
Chinese words after an acronym that open with ``見``, ``參見``, ``詳見``, or
``參閱`` (``RCT（見第二節）``). A lead at the start of a parenthetical or of
its last item, or set off as the item before its last (``the model, i.e.,
SEM``), is read as if absent, and so are quotation marks around the acronym.
A lead is a restatement (such as ``i.e.`` or ``i. e.``, ``viz.``,
``namely``, ``that is``, ``in other words``, ``即``, ``亦即``, ``也就是``) or
a naming lead (such as ``hereafter``, ``henceforth``, ``abbreviated as``,
``referred to as``, ``also known as``, ``aka``, ``called``, ``以下簡稱``,
``下稱``, ``簡稱``, ``又稱``, ``稱為``, ``縮寫為``). So ``structural equation
modeling (i.e., SEM)``, ``structural equation modeling (hereafter SEM)``, and
``結構方程模型（structural equation modeling，以下簡稱「SEM」）`` define
``SEM``. After a restatement, an acronym the words before it do not spell is a
use (``two designs (namely RCT)``); after a naming lead, it is a definition
this check cannot confirm (``two designs (hereafter RCT)``). A cross-reference
with a target before the acronym (``see Section 2``, ``cf. Table 1``,
``參見附錄A``, or ``見`` before a part, page, or place in the text, such as
``見第二節``, but not the word ``見習醫學生``; every item before the acronym
is read as part of it) is read as a restatement is: ``randomized controlled trials (see Section 2, RCT)`` and
``隨機對照試驗（見第二節，RCT）`` define ``RCT``, and ``two designs (see
Section 2, RCT)`` uses it.

Candidates are 2-6 letters or digits, starting with a letter, with at least
two capitals and no more lowercase than uppercase letters (``RCT``, ``eGFR``,
``qPCR``, but not ``2FA``). Plural and possessive forms count as the base
(``RCTs``, ``RCT's``). Matching is whole token, so ``AI`` is never found
inside ``AIDS``. Not candidates: chemical formulas, meaning tokens with a
digit that read as element symbols and counts (``H2O``, ``CO2``, but not
``RCT2``); Roman numerals up to ``XXXIX`` (``II``, ``XII``); ``IV`` and stage
numerals with a letter from A to D and an optional digit (``IIIB``, ``IIID``,
``IA1``) only right after a numbering word, or after a list of numerals that
follows one, in the same sentence, or in a Chinese stage (``Table IV``,
``stage IIIB``, ``stages I through IV``, ``第IV期``, ``IV 期``), since ``IV``
alone is a common acronym; and the statistical symbols ``SD``, ``SE``, and
``CI``. Larger numerals stay candidates, because letter strings such as
``CD``, ``DC``, ``MI``, and ``LV`` are also common acronyms. The plural of an
excluded token is excluded too (``CIs``, ``SDs``).

Not read, with line numbers kept: front matter, code fences, code spans (a
backtick run pairs with the next run of the same length on its line, and a
backslash or a comment marker inside a span is literal), HTML comments
(including ``<!--ref:...-->`` and ``<!--anchor:...-->``), math (inline math
within one line; ``\\$`` is a dollar sign, and ``\\\\$`` a backslash before
math), URLs, link destinations and titles
(``[the protocol](#RCT)``, ``[the site](https://example.org "RCT")``), link
reference definitions (``[RCT]: https://example.org``) and the labels that
name them in full reference links (``[the protocol][RCT]``), ATX and setext
headings, tables (with or without outer pipes, up to a blank line, heading,
list item, blockquote, or thematic break), image lines, caption, note, and
keyword paragraphs (from a line that starts a paragraph or follows an image
and opens with a label such as ``Figure 2.``, ``Table S1.``, ``TABLE III``,
``Supplementary Table 2.``, ``Box 1.``, ``Figure 1 |``, ``圖 2-1：``,
``表一：``, ``Note.``, or ``Keywords:``, up to a blank line; the number must
end the line or come before a period, colon, pipe, or dash, but a dash that
starts a range and an unspaced hyphen (``Table 1-based``) open no label, and
neither do ``Figure 1.2 shows`` and ``Fig. 1 Flow diagram``; a range end is a
number or a labeled number (``Figure 1 – 3``, ``Table 1–Table 3``,
``圖1–圖3``), an end of the number's own kind (a letter after ``1A`` or after
a letter label, a Roman numeral up to 20 above a Roman start, a Chinese
numeral after a Chinese one: ``Figure 1A – C``, ``Table XXXIX–XL``,
``圖一–三``; after a label letter that is also a Roman numeral, C, I, L, V,
or X, a letter one to five after it: ``Table C – D``, but not ``Table C – T
cell counts``) that no hyphen follows
(``Table I – X-ray findings`` is a title), or a single letter right after an
unspaced dash (``Figure 1–C shows``), so a caption title that starts that way
is read as prose), the reference list, author-year citations whose author part
is a run of names, whose dates are years from 1800 to 2099, year pairs or
ranges, ``n.d.``, or ``in press`` (``2020a``, ``1900/1953``, ``n.d.-a``), and
whose locator, if any, is a page, paragraph, chapter, or section
(``(WHO, 2020)``, ``(see Smith et al., 2020, pp. 4, 6; Lee, 2019)``, and the
citations before or after the acronym in ``(Smith, 2020; RCTs)`` and
``(RCTs; Smith, 2020)``), a bracketed
abbreviation right after a capitalized word, as in an APA group author
(``World Health Organization [WHO]``), but not a link (``[RCT](#design)``, or
``[RCT]`` when a link reference definition names it), and author initials in
author lists, whose names are joined by commas, ``and``, or ``&`` and come
before ``et al.`` or a date in a form a citation takes (``Smith JA, García BC,
McDonald EF, and van der Berg GH (2020a)``); prose shaped like such a list, as
in ``Delphi RCT and Bayesian SEM (2020)``, is read as one. In definitions, the
leading words above, citations, group-author brackets, and author lists, a
line break inside a paragraph reads as a space, and a line break or space
between two Chinese characters is ignored.

These rules read Markdown line by line; this is not a full CommonMark parser.
Markdown the rules do not name, such as an HTML block, can be read as prose or
as part of the construct before it, and a named construct can be misread when
it sits inside another one or has no blank line around it.

Scopes come from headings: ``Abstract`` or ``English Abstract`` starts the
English abstract, ``摘要``, ``中文摘要`` or ``Chinese Abstract`` the Chinese
one, and each runs to the next heading of the same or a higher level.
Everything else is the body. A scope is in the input only when a line this
check reads there has a letter. An abstract in another language is a section
this check does not read, listed as a coverage limit, and so is a requested
scope the input does not contain.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check_acronyms.py --input FILE
        [--scopes body,abstract_en,abstract_zh] [--allow ABBR ...]
        [--allow-file FILE] [--lang en|zh-TW] [--json-out FILE]

Prints the Markdown report in ``--lang`` and writes the JSON report to
``--json-out``, which may be neither the input nor the allowlist file. The
Markdown report shows a control or bidirectional character in a heading it
names as its ``\\uXXXX`` escape; the JSON report keeps the heading as written.
Exit 0: the requested scopes were read (``checked``, or ``partial`` with
coverage limits); findings never change the exit status.
Exit 2: nothing was checked (``not_checked``: unsupported format, unreadable
input or allowlist, an unknown scope name, or none of the requested scopes in
the input), and the report says so. A missing report or any other exit status
also means not checked; it is never a clean result.
