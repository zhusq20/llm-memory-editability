"""Shared manuscript hashing for the reviewer-calibration suite (#653).

The corpus assembler (freeze / verify) and the isolated dispatcher must hash
the SAME bytes for `pdf_sha256` and `extracted_text_sha256`, so the extraction
and normalization live here and both import it. The normalization rule is
recorded in the manifest's `extraction` block as `text_normalization` and
compared by `verify` as a hard failure — it is a rule, not a version, so drift
is never downgraded to a warning.

Rule (`TEXT_NORMALIZATION`):
  1. pypdf page texts joined with "\n" (empty pages contribute "");
  2. Unicode NFC;
  3. every lone UTF-16 surrogate code point (U+D800..U+DFFF, which pypdf can
     emit from math / symbol fonts and which strict UTF-8 refuses to encode)
     is replaced by U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER.

Step 3 is what makes the hash computable on real manuscripts: the first ICLR
2026 freeze hit a paper whose extracted text carried 61 lone surrogates and
`str.encode("utf-8")` raised. Replacement is one-to-one, so the page/line
structure the reviewers see is unchanged.
