"""Isolated dispatch of ONE reviewer-calibration panel (#653).

The calibration protocol (`academic-paper-reviewer/references/calibration_mode_protocol.md`)
reuses the pre-v3.6.2 single-call panel engine: five reviewer seats and the
synthesizer each receive their WHOLE agent file as the system prompt and the
bounded inputs (configuration card, manuscript, seat reports) as user content.
It explicitly does NOT opt into the v3.6.2 sprint contract, so this dispatcher
is a sibling of `dispatch_e4_panel.py`, not a mode of it: the E4 harness's
`seats_for` gate rejects any contract mode outside the sprint families, and its
Phase-1/Phase-2 heading slicing reads sprint-only agent subsections.

What IS shared is the infrastructure layer, imported from `dispatch_e4_panel`:
`ClaudeCliTransport` (headless `claude -p --bare` with the emptied tool
whitelist, an allowlisted environment, an empty `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, and
stream-json capture of every assistant message), `Bundle` (write-once
evidence + journal), `Call`/`TransportFailure`/`PreconditionFailure`, and
`card_for` (fence-aware Reviewer Configuration Card slicing).

Isolation axes (they differ from E4's):

  * Gold-label isolation, not manuscript blindness. Every seat sees the
    manuscript (single-call engine); what must NEVER enter any context is the
    gold label. Structurally: this dispatcher reads only `corpus/papers.json`
    (label-free by the assembler's leak guard), the seven agent files, and the
    local PDF cache. `manifests/gold_labels.json` is not on any read path, and
    a startup guard refuses to run if the corpus dir's manifest file is
    reachable through a symlink inside the PDF cache.
  * Content pinning. The manuscript text is extracted from the cached PDF at
    dispatch time and must hash-match the manifest's `extracted_text_sha256`
    (same pypdf major surface; version recorded in the manifest) — a swapped
    or truncated PDF cannot silently review a different document.
  * Substrate plan. This run's plan is locked to `primary_only` (#653 user
    decision); the record carries the plan and the attempt id so the
    protocol's attempt-atomicity rule is auditable. There is no cross-model
    branch in this dispatcher by design; adding one later must implement the
    calibration transport exception in `shared/cross_model_verification.md`.

Three stages, dispatched separately so replicates share frozen cards:

  cards     Per paper, once: field_analyst call -> four Reviewer Configuration
            Cards, frozen under <work-dir>/cards/<paper>/ and reused by every
            replicate (varying cards per replicate would confound calibration).
  panel     Per (paper, replicate): five seat calls (EIC, methodology, domain,
            perspective get their own card; the Devil's Advocate is cardless by
            design) + one synthesizer call over the five seat reports (the
            synthesizer never sees the manuscript). Emits a per-run record JSON
            plus the raw evidence bundle.
  manifest  After the last panel: folds every completed call row from the
            frozen cards and the panel records into ONE write-once
            `execution-manifest.json` (`heldout-execution-manifest/1.0`, the
            per-call evidence a `heldout-measurement/1.1` row references).
            Failed attempts stay in the raw bundles and the blocked records;
            they never enter the manifest (no output hash exists for them).

Fresh context per call is a protocol requirement (ensembling notes); each call
is its own `claude -p` process with an empty sandbox directory as `--add-dir`
(tools are already whitelisted off; the empty sandbox is defense in depth).

Rehearsal findings folded in (2026-09-06, #828): a rejected credential is
detected by a zero-cost `GET /v1/models` preflight before the first billed
call and is never retried when it surfaces mid-run (the CLI took minutes to
report a 401 on a whole-manuscript prompt, and the blind retry doubled it);
an aborted cards stage now leaves a `blocked-cards-<paper>.json` record with
its per-call rows instead of losing them. The second take (2026-09-07) found
two more, both fixed in the shared transport: the text-mode CLI printed only
the last assistant message (a continued synthesis lost its head, decision
line included), and `--bare` still let the operator's global CLAUDE.md,
`language` setting and output style reach the seats.
