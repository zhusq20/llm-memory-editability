"""Shared advisory file locking for ARS scripts (#845).

One backend per host, chosen at import time and published as ``BACKEND``:

* ``"fcntl"`` (POSIX): ``flock``.  Shared and exclusive modes, blocking and
  non-blocking, exactly as before #845.
* ``"msvcrt"`` (Windows): ``locking`` on byte 0 of the lock file.  This
  backend is best-effort and has no CI coverage; it differs from ``flock`` in
  two documented ways that callers decide about rather than paper over:

  - there is no shared mode, so ``exclusive=False`` takes an exclusive lock;
  - there is no indefinite blocking wait, so ``timeout=None`` polls for at
    most ``WINDOWS_BLOCKING_WAIT_SECONDS`` and then raises ``LockTimeout``.

The helper never reads or writes the lock file.  ``msvcrt.locking`` may lock
a byte beyond end-of-file, so an empty lock file is valid on both backends;
callers that require the lock file to stay empty keep that invariant.

Contention on either backend surfaces as ``LockTimeout`` (a
``BlockingIOError`` carrying ``EAGAIN``), including ``timeout=0``, so a
caller can treat "someone else holds it" uniformly.  Every other ``OSError``
propagates unchanged.
