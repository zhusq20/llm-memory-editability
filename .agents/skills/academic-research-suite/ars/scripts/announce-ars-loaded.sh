# SessionStart hook script for the ARS Claude Code plugin (v3.7.0+).
#
# Reads the SessionStart event JSON on stdin and emits a hookSpecificOutput
# JSON with `additionalContext` describing what ARS provides in this session.
# The plugin loader injects that context into the LLM's first turn so the
# user (and Claude) can see, on session start, that ARS is loaded and which
# slash commands and plugin agents are available.
#
# Allowed invokers: Claude Code's plugin loader (SessionStart event).
# This script is safe to run from any context; it does not invoke codex,
# does not write outside its own stdout, and produces no side effects on
# the working tree.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0    Always — even on parse failure, fall back to the long-form announce.
#   2    Reserved (not used; SessionStart cannot block).

# This script intentionally avoids Bash 4+ features (no associative arrays,
# no indirect expansion via `${!var}`, no `<<<` here-strings on the hot
# path). It runs cleanly on macOS stock /bin/bash 3.2 so plugin users
# don't have to `brew install bash` just to see the SessionStart announce.
# `run_codex_audit.sh` does need Bash 4+ — that wrapper guards itself.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Read SessionStart event JSON from stdin and pull `source` (one of
# startup / resume / clear / compact) without taking a hard dependency on
# jq — many ARS users won't have it installed and we want this hook to
# work out of the box.

Slash commands (16) — light modes pin sonnet in frontmatter; the three heavy modes and /ars-citation-check inherit the session model (the v3.7.0 opus floor was retired in the 2026-06 harness pass):
  /ars-full              inherit Full pipeline (research → write → review → revise → finalize)
  /ars-revision-coach    inherit Parse reviewer comments → Revision Roadmap + Response Letter skeleton
  /ars-reviewer          inherit academic-paper-reviewer full mode — simulated peer-review panel
  /ars-plan              sonnet  Socratic chapter-by-chapter planning
  /ars-outline           sonnet  Detailed outline + evidence map (no full draft)
  /ars-revision          sonnet  Revised draft + R&R responses
  /ars-rebuttal-audit    sonnet  QA an existing rebuttal draft against reviewer comments (advisory)
  /ars-abstract          sonnet  Bilingual abstract + keywords
  /ars-lit-review        sonnet  Annotated bibliography in paper format
  /ars-3w                sonnet  WHY / HOW / WHAT three-way paper scan (lighter than lit-review)
  /ars-format-convert    sonnet  Convert paper between LaTeX / DOCX / PDF / Markdown
  /ars-citation-check    inherit Citation error report
  /ars-disclosure        sonnet  venue status bundle / policy-anchor render
  /ars-mark-read         sonnet  Record human-read signal for one or more citation keys
  /ars-unmark-read       sonnet  Rescind a prior human-read mark for one or more citation keys
  /ars-cache-invalidate  sonnet  Drop cached verification rows for one or more citation keys

Plugin agents (4, model: inherit):
  synthesis_agent             Cross-source integration, contradiction resolution, gap analysis
  research_architect_agent    Methodology blueprint (paradigm, method, data strategy)
  report_compiler_agent       APA 7.0 report drafting (Phase 4 + Phase 6)
  screening_reviewer_agent    sr-screener blinded screening reviewer (tools: Read/Grep only)
The first three are v3.6.7-hardened pipeline agents (tools allowlist: Read/Write/Edit/Grep/Glob per #514); sr-screener's screening workflows dispatch the fourth.

Other ARS agents (bibliography_agent, literature_strategist_agent, field_analyst_agent, etc.) remain in-skill prompt templates loaded via WORKFLOW.md, not plugin agents.

Token budget reference: docs/PERFORMANCE.md (a single full pipeline run ≈ \$4–6, order-of-magnitude; measured on Opus 4.x)."
